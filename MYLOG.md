It seems to be so wierd that my previous code (Hermes) didn't work on my new Arduino :-(

Yet to figure out why...

But I wrote a new one this afternoon, and it works well.

Oh, well... it seems that the God just wants me to start from the beginning.

Never mind! I code much quicker than last summer :-P So it won't take long to finish the baseline model!

### 21st
I then come across a really wierd problem... after updating my pi to Stretch, wifi just disappeared... Jesus

### 22nd
What's worse, I got my SD card burnt!!! All works I've done just crashed! My God! I should start from ZERO again!

No time to curse...

### 24th
Well, all the things on fundamental level have been done (I guess).

The Pi controls the Arduino well and also gets the right data from RPLidar.

Let's focus on SLAM then :-)

OMG, the fxxking problem has just been done =) It finally turns out to be the hardware problem that the USB port can not supply enough power!

Guess what measures I have taken? Disable the HDMI, the audio, the Ethernet port, the LEDs... never work! The voltage on the USB port still remains 4.9V!

After a discussion with my supervisor, we decide to change a new Pi. Then everything works on well.

I have to confess it's trivial, but it actually stuck me for two weeks!!! Oh, what a waste of time!!!

Well, it seems that I was solving the commucation/networking problem for the rest of Feb! Those problems on WSL are rly disappointing. Several solutions have been tried, but never did they work. However there is no time left for me to be stuck on the same problem for so long time...

So I must move on... (hope my supervisor can manage a desktop so that I can follow up on ROS)

### 6th
Just changed to a native Ubuntu environment. Then....

All things start working well!!!

I wasted half of a semester solving WSL communication issues...

### 22nd
It took a lot of time to solve the odometry problem...

Currently Gmapping works fine while moving forword or slowly turning left/right. But the axes shown on Rviz still turns to be a bit weird :-( (i.e. moving very FAST or turning a really BIG degree)

Might be solved later.

However, I have to move on now as no time left for covering the details...

(Forgive me :-P)

### 24th
OMG All the process names got lost

No choice but to redo it tomorrow (must get up early)

### 27th
Cartographer configuration done

Map quality and localization accuracy came to be quite good (though a bit slow)

Will be uploaded later (depends on the meeting tomorrow)

### 28th
Time to upload the stuffs running on my laptop (actually loaned from soc :-P)

I think the hardest part may be done successfully.

But still there are some supplimentary experiments needed to be done.

Finally should be the report :-) may be discussed later.

# April
### 25th
Ultimately finished the Final Presentation...

My supervisor is quite friendly, but the evaluator is really scary... always cut in and question me XD But he is actually a quite nice professor, always giving me useful suggestions.

I may never forget the three weeks... Write thesis... revise... revise... and revise again... then prepare slides (less time...)

The most painful days through my undergraduate life :-P

Actually quite meaningful for my graduate study later on :-)
