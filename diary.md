It seems to be so wierd that my previous code (Hermes) didn't work on my new Arduino :-(

Yet to figure out why...

But I wrote a new one this afternoon, and it works well.

Oh, well... it seems that the God just wants me to start from the beginning.

Never mind! I code much quicker than last summer :-P So it won't take long to finish the baseline model!

I then come across a really wierd problem... after updating my pi to Stretch, wifi just disappeared... Jesus

### 22nd
What's worse, I got my SD card burnt!!! All works I've done just crashed! My God! I should start from ZERO again!

No time to curse...
