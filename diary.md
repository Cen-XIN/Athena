It seems to be so wierd that my previous code (Hermes) didn't work on my new Arduino :-(

Yet to figure out why...

But I wrote a new one this afternoon, and it works well.

Oh, well... it seems that the God just wants me to start from the beginning.

Never mind! I code much quicker than last summer :-P So it won't take long to finish the baseline model!

I then come across a really wierd problem... after updating my pi to Stretch, wifi just disappeared... Jesus

### 22nd
What's worse, I got my SD card burnt!!! All works I've done just crashed! My God! I should start from ZERO again!

No time to curse...

Well, all the things on fundamental level have been done (I guess).

The Pi controls the Arduino well and also gets the right data from RPLidar.

Let's focus on SLAM then :-)

OMG, the fxxking problem has just been done =) It finally turns out to be the hardware problem that the USB port can not supply enough power!

Guess what measures I have taken? Disable the HDMI, the audio, the Ethernet port, the LEDs... never work! The voltage on the USB port still remains 4.9V!

After a discussion with my supervisor, we decide to change a new Pi. Then everything works on well.

I have to confess it's trivial, but it actually stuck me for two weeks!!! Oh, what a waste of time!!!
